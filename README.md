This repository has been started to do some of the Mooqita challenges.
The first one is here: https://app.mooqita.org/app/solution?challenge_id=YKgnjCTtuD2AoAmu2

I discovered Mootiqa from the Linux Foundation when reviewing some of their training materials.

A new folder will be created for each challenge.
Any feedback in my method is more than welcome!
